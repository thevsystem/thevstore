# TheVInc (Codename Store.TheV): 
Welcome to the official GitHub repository of TheVInc. Here won't be anything *that* exciting to look at other than the source files we use to customize our [Fourthwall](https://store.thev.to) Page. - Consider this as our in-house extension for Fourthwall.

These Files are:
### Cascaded Style Sheet (thevstore.css)
---
This file is used to import our custom CSS code to the Fourthwall page, allowing us to customize our page in ways that are not yet possible inside Fourthwall itself. By utilizing the power of CSS, we can achieve the look and feel of the page we exactly want. 

### Javascript (thevstore.js)
---
This file is used to bring in additional functionality to the page, such as how the header shrinks and dynamically changes when the user is scrolling through the page.
